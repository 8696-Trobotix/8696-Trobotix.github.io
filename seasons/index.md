# General Information
This site was created during the 2022 off-season.  
Prior to then, much as changed throughout the seasons regarding the organization and documentation of the team's progress.  
Images shown are intended to be the most recent retrievable depiction of the robot.  
Likewise, source code is the most recent retrievable version that makes sense, if applicable, since the team's GitHub does not appear to have existed prior to late 2020.  
However, this is only on the main branches unless specified otherwise, as it would be tiring and bothersome to comb through other repository branches lookng for the right commit.  

> Note: Not all programs that were written or older versions are shown.

Further description may be lacking for some seasons.
___
Happy programming!
